# âš½ Striker Performance Analysis using Machine Learning

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of football strikers' performance using a dataset of striker metrics. It combines data cleaning, descriptive and statistical analysis, feature engineering, clustering, and predictive modeling to classify strikers as "Best Strikers" or "Regular Strikers".

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains performance metrics for football strikers, including:
- Goals Scored
- Assists
- Shots on Target
- Dribbling Success
- Hold-up Play
- Aerial Duels Won
- Defensive Contribution
- Big Game Performance
- Consistency
- Conversion Rate
- Footedness, Nationality, Marital Status, etc.

## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion

Through this project, weâ€™ve built a complete pipeline from raw data to classification and prediction. The analysis helps:
- Identify top-performing strikers
- Compare performance across nationalities
- Predict striker types using machine learning

It serves as a valuable resource for **football analysts**, **coaches**, and **sports data scientists** to make data-driven decisions for team selection, talent identification, and strategy building.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements

- Include more match-level data (pass accuracy, distance covered, etc.)
- Explore advanced ML models like Random Forest or SVM
- Deploy the model with a web-based dashboard
